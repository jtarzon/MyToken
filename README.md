# MyToken

## Overview

This project aims to create a Solidity smart contract for managing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract provides basic functionality to mint new tokens and burn existing ones. It serves as a foundational component for building token-based applications and platforms on Ethereum.

## Description

This project implements a Solidity smart contract that allows users to mint and burn tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract provides essential functionalities for managing token ecosystems, such as creating new tokens and destroying existing ones. It's a fundamental building block for developers interested in creating token-based applications or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on Ethereum.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use this contract, you can download the source code from the repository.

### Executing program

To deploy the contract:

1. Compile the Solidity code using a Solidity compiler like Remix or solc.
2. Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum network using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.
